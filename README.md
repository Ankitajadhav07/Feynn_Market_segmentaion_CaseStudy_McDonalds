### Case Study: Fast Food Analysis

**Step 1: Data Exploration**
- Conducted a principal components analysis to visualize consumer perceptions of McDonald's.
- Identified price (inexpensive vs. costly) and overall sentiment (positive vs. negative) as the primary dimensions.

**Step 2: Segment Extraction Using K-means Clustering**
- Experimented with clustering solutions ranging from 2 to 8 segments.
- Chose a 4-segment solution based on a stability analysis.
- Noted that one segment (Segment 1) exhibited less stability compared to the others.

**Step 3: Segment Extraction Using Mixture Models**
- Applied an alternative statistical method to validate the results.
- Discovered that a 4-segment solution corresponded well with the k-means clustering results.

**Step 4: Segment Analysis Using Regression Models**
- Analyzed factors influencing consumer preferences for McDonald's.
- Identified two primary segments with different preference drivers:
  1. Segment 1 values McDonald's for its taste, speed, affordability, and deliciousness.
  2. Segment 2 prefers McDonald's for its taste, convenience, and healthiness.

**Step 5: Interpretation for Marketing Strategy**
- Recognized varying perceptions and motivations among different segments.
- Proposed tailored marketing messages:
  - For Segment 1: Highlight taste, speed, and cost-effectiveness.
  - For Segment 2: Emphasize convenience and healthier options.

**Step 6: Segment Profiling**
- Created visual profiles to showcase key characteristics of each segment.
- Identified four distinct segments with varying perceptions of McDonald's:
  1. Cheap and greasy
  2. Disgusting and costly
  3. Expensive yet tasty and delicious
  4. Delicious, affordable, and somewhat healthy

**Step 7: Segment Description**
- Analyzed additional variables like age, gender, and affinity for McDonald's within each segment.
- Discovered associations between segment membership and these variables:
  - Segment 2 includes more men; Segment 4 includes more women.
  - Segment 3 tends to be younger than other segments.
  - Segment 4 exhibits the highest affinity for McDonald's, while Segment 2 shows the least.

**Step 8: Target Segment Selection**
- Developed a segment evaluation plot based on visit frequency and preference for McDonald's.
- Identified Segments 3 and 4 as the most attractive (frequent visitors with a high preference for McDonald's).
- Noted potential for improvement in Segment 1.

**Step 9: Marketing Mix Customization**
- Example strategy for Segment 3 (young customers who like McDonald's but find it pricey):
  - Introduce a "McSuperBudget" line (Product and Price).
  - Use promotional channels popular among young people (Promotion).
  - Consider separate "McSuperBudget" lanes in stores (Place).

**Step 10: Evaluation and Monitoring**
- Continuously monitor segments for changes (e.g., Segment 3's income growth).
- Stay alert for broader market shifts (e.g., new competitors).
- Adjust strategy as needed based on ongoing evaluation.
